# C Program To Visualize A QuadTree Using SDL2

## A Non-Generic QuadTree I Made With SDL Primitives To Make A Faster Particle System

## Screenshots

**_TODO_**

## Build

The program has only two dependencies
[SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org) and [SDL2_gfx](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sdl2gfx)

Certain settings can be modified in the `Makefile`

To compile the program just run `make` in either the root directory or in `src/`

To run, run `make run`
